# Metal Order Calculator

This tool is used to automate calculations before purchasing steel. It's being made for use specifically for DNV. I'm going to build a protoype first to get a basic design, basic functionality and then test a method of distribution. I'll make a new official repo when I'm finished. (Make sure to also look up github licensing to select a proper license).

## Planning

Let's look at a basic game plan for this:

1. Understanding the problem
2. Basic function design
3. UI decisions
4. Distribution
5. Minimum Viable Product
6. Potential Future
