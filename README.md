# Metal Order Calculator

This tool is used to automate calculations before purchasing steel. It's being made for use specifically for DNV. I'm going to build a protoype first to get a basic design, basic functionality and then test a method of distribution. I'll make a new official repo when I'm finished. (Make sure to also look up github licensing to select a proper license).

## Planning

Let's look at a basic game plan for this:

1. Understanding the problem
2. Basic function design
3. UI decisions
4. Distribution
5. Minimum Viable Product
6. Potential Future Features

### Understanding the problem

This process is meant to calculate how many pieces of varying sizes can be cut from a larger piece of steel of varied size as well.

To start, it's probably easiest to select a predetermined set of values, make the calculations work and set the functions to work with any set of variables. By the end, the program should be able to take any set of sizes and calculate if they can cut enough for a job.
